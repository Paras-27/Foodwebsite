                <p>Pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some
                    combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other
                    ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a

                <p>Punjabi chole masala or chana masala is one of the most popular curry dishes from India. In fact in
                    north India no wedding or party is complete until you have chole masala on the menu. I remember
                    whenever we would call someone over for lunch or dinner, mom would almost always make chole.
